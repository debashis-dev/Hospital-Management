# Hospital Management System

## Overview
The Hospital Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations. This system provides functionalities for managing patient information, doctor schedules, appointments, treatments, and billing processes. The application aims to simplify the hospital's administrative tasks and improve patient care through efficient data handling and retrieval.

## Features
### Patient Management
- Add, update, and delete patient records.
- View patient history, including diagnosis, treatments, and prescriptions.

### Doctor Management
- Maintain doctor profiles, specializations, and availability.
- Assign doctors to patients based on specialization and schedules.

### Appointment Scheduling
- Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
- Doctors can view and manage their daily schedules.

### Administrative Dashboard
- Admin users can manage staff, view hospital statistics, and generate reports.
- Manage user roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, admin staff) and permissions.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- HTML, CSS, JSP, Bootstrap

### Backend
- Java (Servlets)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

### Database
- MySQL

### Tools
- Apache Tomcat
- MySQL Workbench

## Architecture
### Frontend
- The user interface is developed using HTML, CSS, JSP, and Bootstrap to provide a seamless and interactive experience for patients, doctors, and hospital staff.

### Backend
- Java Servlets handle business logic and user requests, providing communication between the front end and the database.
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used to interact with the MySQL database, executing queries for CRUD operations.

### Database Structure
- **Patients Table**: Stores patient information (name, age, gender, contact details, medical history).
- **Doctors Table**: Stores doctor information (name, specialization, availability).
- **Appointments Table**: Manages appointment scheduling (patient ID, doctor ID, date, time).

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction**: Patients and hospital staff access the system via a web interface, with distinct roles and permissions.
2. **Request Handling**: Requests from the user interface are sent to Java Servlets, which process the request and interact with the database via JDBC.
3. **Data Storage**: All hospital-related data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database.
4. **Dynamic Pages**: The application uses JSP to dynamically render pages based on user interactions, such as viewing patient records or appointment schedules.

## Benefits
- Efficient management of hospital resources and patient care.
- Improved appointment scheduling and reduced manual errors.
- Centralized database for easy data retrieval and management.

## Future Enhancements
- Pharmacy management.
- Inventory control.
- Laboratory results integration.
- Payment Gateway Integration
